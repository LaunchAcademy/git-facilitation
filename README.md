# Git Facilitation








## Git Review Topics (Second Clinic)
- PR process one more time
- Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Branching off of an existing branch
- Avoid copy/paste git commands online
- Strongly encourage pairs to review one another's code!

### Suggestions for Group Effectiveness
- Well scoped PRs
- Determine the structure of your meetings so that they don't take up too much time
- You can add us to codeship so that we can see your builds
- If you have a question regarding procedure, tag us in a message in your channel.

* clarification on testing
- ERB Feature: capybara (no controller testing)
- React Feature: controller tests for the API endpoint
- If you add custom ruby methods: rspec unit tests


## Codeship Problems
- Add all of your teammates and EEs to your codeship project
- Make sure to add an example yarn test
- make sure you have run rake db:migrate to update your schema

## Feature Scope
*What is too big?*
- if the PR has more than one feature
- or if a PR has a feature, and some code that might be useful for a future feature

*What is too small?*
https://github.com/Cddumont/Group-project/pull/5/files

*What about links to pages that are not created yet?*
- that would be outside of the scope of the feature, and those links should be added when the separate page is created
